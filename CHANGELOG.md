## 0.2.5
* Removed `require` from app worker context to work around change in node 7. `__debug__.require` is still present for applications which need it

## 0.2.4
* Allowed using this extension in a workspace with the react-native project in a subfolder.
* Ignore references to inline sourcemaps, in the hopes of finding another reference to a map file
* Exposed `react-native-tools.showInternalLogs` and `react-native-tools.logLevel` to print additional output for debugging issues with the extension.
* Added CHANGELOG.md!

## 0.2.3
* Added a workaround for max-stack issues with react-native 0.37
