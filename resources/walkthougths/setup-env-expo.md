# Expo applications

Prepare your environment by following the [Expo Quickstart instruction](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/).

- Ensure install expo using: `npm i -g expo`.
- Create new project using: `npx create-expo-app@latest`, you can send `--template` option to choose different template.
- Build and launch you expo app using ExpoGo or expo dev client: [Start developing](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/start-developing/).

You can verify that everything is working correctly and that the environment is ready for use with the `React Native: Expo Run Doctor` in command palette.
