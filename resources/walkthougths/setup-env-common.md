# React Native application

Prepare your environment by following the [React native Quickstart instruction](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). You can create your app using 3rd party framework like Expo or create app without framework.

- Ensure install react-native using: `npm i -g react-native`.
- Create new project without framework using: `npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init`.
- Start metro using: `npm start`.
- Build and launch app using" `npm run android`.

You can verify that everything is working correctly and that the environment is ready for use with the `React Native: Run Doctor` in command palette.
