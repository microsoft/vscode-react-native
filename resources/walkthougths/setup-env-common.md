# Getting started
Before going any further, please check out the following information to help you get started with React Native Tools successfully.

Make sure that you:

- [have a working React Native environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
- have the [`emulator`](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline) utility available in your `PATH` if you're developing Android applications using emulators.
- have your React Native project root folder open in VS Code.

Please notice that the extension uses `.vscode/.react` directory at the project root to store intermediate files required for debugging. Although these files usually get removed after debug session ends, you may want to add this directory to your project's `.gitignore` file.
